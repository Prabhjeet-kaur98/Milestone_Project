#         Milestone 4

# I am writing to provide an update on the current status of our project and to share the progress made in resolving various issues.

Throughout the development process, I encountered a variety of challenges on both the front and back end of the project. These issues were meticulously documented in the milestone report as per your instructions. I want to assure you that I have diligently worked on addressing each of these challenges.

In the front end, I tackled issues related to specific issues such as design inconsistencies, etc. To enhance the user experience, I implemented new design of booking and sign up page. These adjustments have significantly improved the overall visual appeal and usability of the front-end components.

Simultaneously, on the back end, I faced challenges pertaining to specific issues such as database connectivity, server errors, etc]. Through careful debugging and optimization, I successfully resolved these issues. The back-end functionality is now robust, ensuring seamless communication with the front-end components.
# Improvements till now

# Design Inconsistency in Home Page: I identified and resolved design inconsistencies on the home page, ensuring a harmonious layout with appropriate background colors and text.

# Database Connectivity Issues: During the database integration phase, I encountered issues when connecting to the cPanel. After thorough debugging and troubleshooting, I successfully resolved these issues, ensuring seamless communication between the application and the database.

# Zoom Issue on cPanel: While connecting the application to the cPanel, I faced a challenge where all website pages would zoom up. I resolved this issue, and the application now functions correctly on both cPanel and localhost environments.
