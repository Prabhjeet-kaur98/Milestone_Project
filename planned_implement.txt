                Planned Implementation
  
My name is Prabhjeet Kaur. I wanted to share some valuable feedback I received during a recent project discussion. One of my peers highlighted a few areas of improvement in my project, and I am committed to addressing these issues to enhance the overall quality of my work.
Feedback from peers: 
Firstly, there were concerns raised about the security of user passwords. To address this, I have decided to implement more robust password hashing techniques. I will be referring to PHP book code and reviewing Laracast videos to gain a better understanding of best practices in securing login information. This update is crucial to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user credentials.
Additionally, there were observations about the home page, specifically regarding text color and background color. I acknowledge the importance of a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, and I am committed to rectifying these concerns. I will carefully review the design aspects of my home page, making necessary adjustments to improve text color readability and background color aesthetics.
How to implement changes:
 To implement these changes effectively, I have set a goal to complete these fixes by Milestone 4 of the project. I am confident that with the resources at my disposal, including PHP book code and Laracast videos, I will be able to enhance the security features of my project and improve the overall user experience by addressing the mentioned design issues.
I appreciate the constructive feedback provided by my peers, as it helps me grow and refine my skills as a developer. Thank you for your understanding, and I am excited to showcase the improvements in my project upon completion.
Best regards,
Prabhjeet Kaur
